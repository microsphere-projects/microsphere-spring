/**
 * Enables Spring's caching functionality with TTL (Time-To-Live) support.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is an extension of Spring's {@link EnableCaching} and provides additional
 * Time-To-Live capabilities for cached data. It allows developers to configure the duration
 * for which cache entries should remain valid, helping manage cache expiration more effectively.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Example Usage</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Configuration
 * @EnableTTLCaching
 * public class CachingConfig {
 *     // Cacheable beans and configurations go here
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Customizing Behavior</h3>
 * You can customize the proxying behavior and order of execution like in standard Spring caching:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #proxyTargetClass()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #mode()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #order()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * These settings affect how caching advice is applied across your application. For example,
 * using the AspectJ mode enables more comprehensive interception compared to the default proxy-based approach.
 * </p>
